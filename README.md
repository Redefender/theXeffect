# theXeffect
An app to help users track their habits and keep themselves motivated! Don't break the chain!

Idea inspired by r/theXeffect. There are a lot of streak tracker apps, but marking a habit done for the day behind a screen doesn't compare to marking on paper. With this app, the user can print the perfect paper calender effortlessly.

The app includes login functionality to store previous habits.
