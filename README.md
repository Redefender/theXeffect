# theXeffect
An app that help users track their habits and keep them motivated!

Idea inspired by r/theXeffect. There are a lot of streak tracker apps, but a common complaint is that marking a task done behind a screen doesn't feel as good as doing it on paper. With this app, the user will be able to have the appropriate calender without having to create it manually.

The app includes login functionality to store previous habits.
