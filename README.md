# theXeffect
An app that prints a PDF to help users track their habits and keep them motivated!

Idea inspired by r/theXeffect. There are a lot of streak tracker apps out there, but a common complaint is that when marking a task done for the day behind a screen the reward just isn't the same. Also, making the actual calender for the tracker on paper takes a little work. 

With this app the user will be able to list their habits, duration, and quickly be able to print it out.
